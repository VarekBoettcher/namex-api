Identify Name Parts

1) Pull back  parts of speech for each word in a name as part of the query.  Set-up an english  dictionary table with word, part of speech, definition or we get the examiner to flag words an distinctive or descriptive.
let the miro-service determine their is at least one noun that is not the designation and at least one pro-noun or adjective,  strip out all stops words.

Cant do this at names import time, doesnt make sense.  do we have another document index that is the english dictionary? then we can pass the name formatted in teh query against the dictionary index to get the payload back..
